# CSS Column Gallery Demo

![Cover](cover.webp)

## Description

This is a demo of the `column-width` CSS property to make a responsive masonry gallery, that removes the need of using **media queries** to make responsive websites and galleries. The wider the screen, more columns will appear. In the mobile view you'll get a single column. With this trick you avoid the use of **flex** or **grid** container.

## Tech used

This demo was built using the famous [Astro](https://astro.build) framework to make simple websites.
